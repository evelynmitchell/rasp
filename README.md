Implementing RASP transformer language from ["Thinking like Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06981.pdf) paper. In the current stage all of the written code is with manual checking and is available in `rasp.py`. All these functions would eventually be replaced by trained neural network models.

### Tests

Currently tests are written in `test_rasp.py` and will be improved upon as more complicated things are built.
